Grater helps with generating test data prior to testing DAO's, stored procedures or any other service that requires
relational data. 

How It Works
------------
Grater has knowledge of your relational database model including primary keys, foreign keys and required columns.
It allows you to succintly generate test data by specifying only the fields you are interested in. You leave the boring,
but required, field generation to Grater including foreign key records. This leaves your test case succint and
free from the noise of populating uninteresting fields.
